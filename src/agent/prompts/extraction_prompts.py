Prompts for Memory Extraction from Trajectories

These prompts guide the LLM to extract generalizable reasoning strategies
from agent trajectories for DES formulation design tasks.
"""

SUCCESS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) formulation design. You will be given a DES design task and the corresponding trajectory that represents how an agent successfully accomplished the task.

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's successful trajectory.

The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar DES formulation tasks.

## Important Notes
- You must first think why the trajectory was successful, and then summarize the insights.
- You can extract at most 3 memory items from the trajectory.
- You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
- Do not mention specific chemical names in the title or description, but rather focus on generalizable insights about DES design principles.
- Focus on **reasoning strategies** (e.g., "prioritize H-bond analysis", "check viscosity constraints"), not just factual knowledge.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item 1
## Title: <concise identifier of the strategy, e.g., "Prioritize Hydrogen Bond Network Analysis">
## Description: <one sentence summary of when/how to apply this strategy>
## Content: <1-3 sentences describing the reasoning steps and decision rationales>

# Memory Item 2
## Title: ...
## Description: ...
## Content: ...

# Memory Item 3
## Title: ...
## Description: ...
## Content: ...
```

## Input

**Task Description:**
{task_description}

**Target Material:** {target_material}
**Target Temperature:** {target_temperature}°C
**Constraints:** {constraints}

**Agent Trajectory:**
{trajectory}

**Final Result:**

Now, extract generalizable reasoning strategies from this successful trajectory:"""


FAILURE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) formulation design. You will be given a DES design task and the corresponding trajectory that represents how an agent attempted to solve the task but failed.

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's failed trajectory.

The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar DES formulation tasks, helping avoid similar mistakes.

## Important Notes
- You must first reflect and think why the trajectory failed, and then summarize what lessons you have learned or strategies to prevent the failure in the future.
- You can extract at most 3 memory items from the trajectory.
- You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
- Do not mention specific chemical names in the title or description, but rather focus on generalizable pitfalls and preventative strategies.
- Focus on **reasoning patterns that led to failure** (e.g., "neglected viscosity constraints", "ignored literature warnings"), not just what went wrong.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item 1
## Title: <concise identifier of the pitfall/lesson, e.g., "Verify Component Compatibility Before Proposing">
## Description: <one sentence summary of the failure pattern and how to avoid it>
## Content: <1-3 sentences describing what went wrong and the corrective strategy>

# Memory Item 2
## Title: ...

PARALLEL_MATTS_PROMPT = """You are an expert in Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) formulation design. You will be given a DES design task and multiple trajectories showing how an agent attempted the task. Some trajectories may be successful, and others may have failed.

## Guidelines
Your goal is to compare and contrast these trajectories to identify the most useful and generalizable strategies as memory items.

Use self-contrast reasoning:
- Identify patterns and strategies that consistently led to success.
- Identify mistakes or inefficiencies from failed trajectories and formulate preventative strategies.
- Prefer strategies that generalize beyond specific chemical systems or exact formulations.

## Important Notes
- Think first: Why did some trajectories succeed while others failed?
- You can extract at most 5 memory items from all trajectories combined.
- Do not repeat similar or overlapping items.
- Do not mention specific chemical names in the title or description — focus on generalizable DES design principles and reasoning patterns.
- Make sure each memory item captures actionable and transferable insights.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item 1
## Title: <the title of the memory item>
## Description: <one sentence summary of the memory item>
## Content: <1-5 sentences describing the insights learned>
