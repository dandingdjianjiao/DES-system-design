DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage.

Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22].

To our knowledge, the physical properties of the mixture formed by D-glucose and DES at different temperatures have not been reported in the literatures.\n\n---\n\nDocument 2 (Score: 0.167, Source: 21f35180..., Page: 1):\nInitially, ChCl was dried at $8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 6 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and cooled to room tem­ perature in a desiccator. ChCl and F were mixed in the sealed glass bottles at different molar ratios (1:1–4), and placed in a water bath with magnetic stirring at $7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ until obtaining clear and transparent liquids.

For this purpose, $3 . 2 9 \\mathrm { g }$ PChCl, ${ 8 2 7 \\mu \\mathrm { L } }$ of DCA and $1 . 7 2 { \\mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ decanoic acid were transferred into a $1 0 \\mathrm { - m L }$ glass test tube, and the tube was capped.

A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ...\n\n---\n\nDocument 7 (Score: 0.152, Source: 2bee282a..., Page: 7):\nDES are characterized by their lower freezing points than that of the individual components. Table 2 lists the freezing points of ADES reported in literature. Especially, ADES with a freezing point lower than $5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ are more attractive because of the wider liquid range to act as solvents or liquid catalysts in many fields. The depression of freezing points is related to ...\n\n---\n\nDocument 8 (Score: 0.149, Source: 0a226ef3..., Page: 6):\nThe characterization of the synthesized DES was performed by analyzing the formed DES with TGA, FT-IR, and HNMR.
