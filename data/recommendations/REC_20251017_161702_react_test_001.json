                "text": "To overcome the limitations of high price and toxicity of ILs, a new generation of green solvents—deep eutectic solvents (DESs)—have emerged [23]. A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",
