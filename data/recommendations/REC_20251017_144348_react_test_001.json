DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

Exactly $0 . 1 0 { \\mathrm { g } }$ of the biological sample (fish or macroalgae) was added to a known volume $( 1 . 5 { - } 3 . 5 \\mathrm { m L } )$ of ChClOx and stirred at $1 2 0 \\mathrm { r p m }$ for a specified time interval $( 2 0 { -...\n\n---\n\nDocument 6 (Score: 0.155, Source: 08e506ad..., Page: 1):\nTo overcome the limitations of high price and toxicity of ILs, a new generation of green solvents—deep eutectic solvents (DESs)—have emerged [23]. A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ...\n\n---\n\nDocument 7 (Score: 0.152, Source: 2bee282a..., Page: 7):\nDES are characterized by their lower freezing points than that of the individual components. Table 2 lists the freezing points of ADES reported in literature. Especially, ADES with a freezing point lower than $5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ are more attractive because of the wider liquid range to act as solvents or liquid catalysts in many fields.
