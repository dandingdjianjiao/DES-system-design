Due to the mild acid-base catalysis mechanism provided from DES, unstable ether bonds and some C–C bonds between phenylpropane units in lignin structure could be broken [20], thus resulting in the depolymerization of lignin macromolecule and the regeneration of lignin fractions with higher ArOH content, lower molecular weight and nano size [21]. Moreover, it was found that the addition of a third component (such as alcohols [22], lewis acids [23], water (W) [24], etc.) to binary DES could modulate the physicochemical properties of DES to a certain extent and enhance its pretreatment effectiveness upon lignocellulose. Among them, water has low viscosity, low cost, wide sources, and it is one of the few natural substances that can act as a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor [25–27]. Therefore, the addition of a certain amount of water as a third component could decrease the viscosity of DES dramatically, thus stimulating the mass transfer and adjusting the interactions among DES components, and leading to an improvement of pretreatment effi­ ciency of DES on lignocellulose [26,28].",

A DES is generally composed of two or three non-toxic components that are capable of associating with each other through hydrogen bonds [22]. DESs typically have a very high depression in freezing point and are liquids at temperatures ranging from $2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C$ to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } C$ [23]. Choline chloride (ChCl), an inexpensive, biodegradable, and non-toxic quaternary ammonium salt, is widely used as one of the components in the formation of DESs [24]. When combined with non-toxic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), such as carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), urea, or polyols (e.g., glycerol), ChCl is capable of rapidly forming a liquid [22–24]. These mixtures can be prepared with high purity and do not react with water, which allows for easy storage. In addition, they are biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, non-flammable, and inexpensive [22]. Charge delocalization that is achieved through hydrogen bonding between the halide anion (e.g., $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ in ChCl) with an HBD moiety is responsible for formation of the liquid [23].",

Moreover, it was found that the addition of a third component (such as alcohols [22], lewis acids [23], water (W) [24], etc.) to binary DES could modulate the physicochemical properties of DES to a certain extent and enhance its pretreatment effectiveness upon lignocellulose. Among them, water has low viscosity, low cost, wide sources, and it is one of the few natural substances that can act as a hydrogen bond donor or a hydrogen bond acceptor [25–27]. Therefore, the addition of a certain amount of water as a third component could decrease the viscosity of DES dramatically, thus stimulating the mass transfer and adjusting the interactions among DES components, and leading to an improvement of pretreatment effi­ ciency of DES on lignocellulose [26,28].",

However, its water-insoluble crystalline structure together with the highly packed polymetric macromolecules have all restricted the succedent widespread applications because of its poor dissolution in the conventional solvents.

Due to the mild acid-base catalysis mechanism provided from DES, unstable ether bonds and some C–C bonds between phenylpropane units in lignin structure could be broken [20], thus resulting in the depolymerizati...\n\n---\n\nDocument 5 (Score: 0.179, Source: 0c1da476..., Page: 11):\nInd Crops Prod. 2018;112:18–23.   \n[21] Hu S, Zhang Z, Zhou Y, et al.
